# Antibody_Drug_Modeling
This is a customized pharmacokinetics modeling. Two main applications:

1. [Simulate and visualize the antibody(or any molecule) uptake in the tumor.](https://github.com/ccchang0111/Antibody_Drug_Modeling/blob/master/Demo_DrugUptake.md)
2. Fit the PET images and calculate the target concentration (and many other parameters).
